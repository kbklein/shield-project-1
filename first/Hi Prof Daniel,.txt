Hi Prof Daniel, 

Thank you so much for reaching out, I have attached my resume to this email alongside a few thoughts to the questions you asked. 

What I’ve learned about myself in the MS program
I’ve come to realize that I’m driven by impact. That’s really what pulled me toward cybersecurity in the first place. The more I learn, the more I see how much this work matters and not just to companies, but to real people relying on safe systems every day.

This MS program has pushed me to grow in ways I didn’t expect. Moving to a new country was hard, figuring things out from scratch, balancing school and the pace of the city, it’s taught me how to adapt, stay focused, and keep going even when things feel uncertain. Through it all, I’ve learned that I want to use what I know to protect, uplift, and create something useful for others.

My 5-year plan
In the next five years, I see myself working in a role where I help shape cybersecurity strategy. I want to be part of something meaningful, like protecting healthcare systems, financial services, or infrastructure where security really affects people’s lives.

At the same time, I want to keep building something of my own. I’m passionate about helping people who don’t usually have a clear way into this field. That includes immigrants, students who don’t have strong networks, and anyone trying to pivot into tech from a different background. I want to take everything I’ve learned so far and use it to make that journey easier for someone else.

Resources and community in New York
New York has opened up opportunities I didn’t have back home. I’ve been able to attend cybersecurity events, connect with professionals, and learn from people who are doing the kind of work I want to do. Those conversations, even quick ones, have shaped how I think and helped me grow.

I’ve also been lucky to meet people who genuinely want to help. Some have given feedback on my projects, others have shared job leads or checked in when things felt tough. And honestly, professors like you who share your stories, offer guidance, and take time to support students—you’ve helped more than you probably realize. That kind of encouragement has made a big difference for me.

Thanks again for your support. I truly appreciate it.

Warmly,

Can you send me your resume? Also could you answer these questions?

What have you learned about yourself since starting the MS program? 
What is your 5 year plan? 
What resources/communities have been helpful for you here in NY that you didn't have previously?

Hi Professor Dan 

I hope you’re doing well! I’ve been meaning to reach out because your work and teaching have genuinely inspired me. Your career motivates me to aim high, I’d feel incredibly fortunate to follow even partly in your footsteps someday (I'll be in touch separately on career guidance)

I'm about to take a big step that's both exciting and a little daunting. As an international student from Zimbabwe, I’m applying for the EB-2 National Interest Waiver (NIW), a visa that allows people to remain in the U.S. and contribute significantly to key areas, like cybersecurity. I plan to file this application right after I graduate, and recommendation letters will be crucial to clearly demonstrate why my work matters here.

That's why I’m reaching out, I’d be incredibly grateful if you’d consider writing me a letter of recommendation. Your support would mean the world, and I truly can’t think of anyone whose endorsement I’d value more. If you have any PhD-level colleagues who might also be willing to offer a brief letter of support, an introduction would be deeply appreciated. Additionally, if you have suggestions for meaningful projects I could undertake to strengthen my application, I’d love to hear them (I have until graduation to complete them).

Of course, I’d be happy to provide my résumé, more details about the NIW, or even a draft letter, whatever makes this easiest for you.

Thank you so much for considering this, and for all the inspiration you’ve given me, it truly means a lot
